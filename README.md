Python script for processing binary data analysis of brain activity in mice and exporting to CSV as desire

# üê≠ Usage

1. By default the script will fetch the files in the `Data` folder.

```
python BinaryDataAnalysis.py
```
2. After running the script a csv file will be created inside the folders located in the specified path. The name of the csv file will be the date and time it was scanned.

## Output: 
```
